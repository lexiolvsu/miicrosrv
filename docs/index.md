## miicrosrv
miicrosrv is an MSN TV 2 server that can be customized to your liking. It is inspired by [minisrv](https://github.com/zefie/zefie_wtvp_minisrv/tree/master), which is the same concept but for the original MSN TV and WebTV services.

It is made using Python by lexiolvsu and TendingStream73, with help from wtv-411.
